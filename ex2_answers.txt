1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
Accuracy for 1 hidden units: 67.5 %
Accuracy for 2 hidden units: 67.25 %
Accuracy for 3 hidden units: 90.75 %
Accuracy for 4 hidden units: 90.5 %
Accuracy for 5 hidden units: 91.25 %
Accuracy for 20 hidden units: 90.0 %
Accuracy for 50 hidden units: 90.25 %

According to these values,As the number of hidden nodes increases, the model can learn more complex patterns, 
improving accuracy at first. But beyond a certain point, too many hidden nodes cause overfitting, 
where the model memorizes training data and performs worse on new data.

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase? 

Small number of hidden nodes :
The model is too simple and lacks enough capacity to capture the underlying patterns. This leads to underfitting, where both training and test accuracy are low.

Moderate number of hidden nodes :
The model has just the right complexity to capture important patterns without overfitting. This typically leads to the best accuracy on both training and test data.

Large number of hidden nodes :
The model becomes overly complex, capable of fitting even noise in the training data. While training accuracy remains high or even perfect, the test accuracy often decreases due to poor generalization. This is overfitting.
